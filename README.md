# Stream New Tab Chrome Extension

A simple bare bones new tab replacement for Chrome that has a digital clock and an interactive stream graph that changes on click.

Colors of the streamgraph are randomly generated every new tab instance.

Stream graph art was inspired by Airbnb's Visx library - https://airbnb.io/visx/streamgraph
